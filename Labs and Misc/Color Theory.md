# Color Theory in Data Visualization (a short guide)

Choosing the right color combination or color palette for your visualization is very important, the data we encounter daily would lose its depth, its vibrancy, and its meaning if not depicted in the right hues. Understaning colors and patterns is a very powerful tool in the arsenal of a data visualization practitioner.

<p>In this section, we will look at a few good practices to follow while representing insightful data.</p>

### 1. Stay consistent
Consider using same color for same variables to avoid confusion and to not overdo the visuals. Also make sure you always explain which color represents what part of the visualization through legends.

### 2. Font size and contrast
Make sure your viewers can read the texual part of the visualization. It is very essential to maintain readbility by having high contrast between your text color and color of the visual.

### 3. Gradients and Greys
Sometimes using too many colors can be very distracting like in case of a treemap or heatmap. In those cases, we can make use of shades of a particular color to convey the insight in a more effective manner.

It is also a good practice to choose two diverging colors to depict opposites, for example, a heatmap showing an average in grey and the two extremes can be red and green.

Also, sometimes to highlight a statistic, dimming the rest of the graph (by using shades of grey) to highlight what's important in the appropriate color can do the trick.

While gradients can be a great way of communicating data where concentrations of the same type are being depicted, avoid using them for displaying categorical data, which is, in most cases, always unrelated to each other.

### 4. Ensure accessibility
There might be a portion of your viewers who are colorblind, be mindful about using colors which can be easily read and understood by those masses as well. There are tool avaiable online like Coblis or Adobe Color that can detect how colorblind friendly is your visualization.
